# File-I-O-
This program prompts the user for a name. After a name is entered it is compared against two text files: boynames.txt and girlnames.txt. 
Each file contains 1000 names as well as their ranking in popularity. The name entered by the user is compared against the names in  
the text files and the user is then told how that name ranks in popularity across both genders.
